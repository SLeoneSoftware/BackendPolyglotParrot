# BackendPolyglotParrot


This is the API I created to store user data for my web app "Polyglot Parrot". It can be used as a template for any basic social media application. In retrospect, not all conventions w/ HTTP are followed and some of the database format doesn't exactly follow convention (nonrelational databases can be tricky).

I will add revamping this to my todo list so that it can serve as a better template for learners in the future.
