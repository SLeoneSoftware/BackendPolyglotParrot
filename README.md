# polyglot-parrot-api

## Project Description

This is the API I created to store and send user data for my web app "Polyglot Parrot". It can be used as a template for any basic social media application. Initially made in summer 2019; I recently revamped it to follow conventions w/ regards to REST Endpoints and database schemas. The language progression feature has not yet been revamped; all of this code is currently commented out so that it can be referenced.

## Technologies

This API was created using Python3, Flask, MongoDB, and other various libraries for specific functions. SQLite3 was formerly used for the exam portion with language progression. However, this language progression feature didn't quite follow database conventions; it stored data that shouldn't have existed

## Use

This was made as part of a social network app. But, it can be modified to easily serve as the backend for someone who just wants a simple friending/posting social network app and wants to make a frontend themselves; other things like classification of the text language via markov chain can be ignored.

To use:

1) Clone the Project and cd into it
2) python (or python3) main.py
